Project 1 
We will use the Product Reviews dataset which has around 25000 customer reviews. Our end goal will be to give a rating according to the review given. We have done Sentiment Analysis using RNN. Recurrent Neural Networks are a type of neural network which uses previous information to give output. Further I have also used LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) which is an extension to RNN, to further increase the accuracy and for correct prediction.




Project 2 
This project aims to build a next-word prediction model using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. The model is trained on a text file named pizza.txt and is designed to predict the next word in a sequence based on the preceding words. In project I have used NLP and Deep Learning to predict the next words in a sequence. Starting by preprocessing the text, splitting it into sentences and tokenizing the words. Word embeddings capture semantic relationships, feeding into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with an LSTM layer to handle sequential data and learn long-term dependencies. Sequences are padded for consistent length, and a Dense layer with softmax activation predicts the next word's probability. For example, given "Pizza have different", the model predicts "become a symbol of comfort" as the next 5 words. This approach combines text preprocessing, word embeddings, and a deep learning model for next-word prediction. The model was trained for 500 epochs to improve accuracy. The project demonstrates the power of NLP and deep learning in generating text.
